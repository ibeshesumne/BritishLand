        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a highly motivated economics graduate, I am passionate about using economic principles to tackle complex societal issues. My studies helped me understand key economic theory and I am keen to apply this knowledge to real-world problems. My knowledge of behavioural economics was useful for the analysis of data relevant to the profile and decisions made by consumers.

In my current role, assisting with the day-to-day financial accounts taught me the importance of optimising efficiency in the long term interests of the company. It enhanced my ability to make a useful contribution in the analysis of data for the team involved in the critical policy decision process.

I am dedicated to leveraging the skills acquired through my education and current role to actively contribute to sustainable development, striving for a career that not only aligns with my passion but also has a positive impact on society.</p>
